	<h4><em>Grind: a group of sharks</em></h4>
	<p>Sharks are a group of fish that have a skeleton made of
		cartilage.  They have between 5 and 7 gills on the sides of
		their heads.  They also have fins which are attached at the
		chest rather than the head.  There are over 470 species of 
		sharks.  They can range in size from about 6 1/2 inches in 
		length up to approximately 39 feet.  Sharks generally do not
		live in freshwater and prefer the deep water of the ocean.  
		There are a few species, such as the bull shark and river 
		shark, which can survive in both fresh and salt water.  
		Sharks have multiple sets of teeth.  Although humans are 
		generally terrified of apex, or predator, sharks, such as the
		great white shark, their activities actually threaten the 
		survival of these sharks.</p>

		<h3><a name="Article"><a/>Why Sharks Bite People</h3>
		<section>
			<h3>Theories</h3>
			<p>Several theories have been put forward by experts as to why white sharks sometimes 
			bite people.  In this article we examine three of the most prominent theories
			and look at why most of these incidents are non-fatal.  Here are some of the main
			theories put forward to explain what might be happening.</p>
		</section>
			<h4>Investigatory Theory:</h4>
			<p>White sharks are intelligent and curious apex predators with complex behaviour
				patterns.  They sit at the top of the marine food chain, and although they are 
				hunted by man, they have no natural predator.  Unfortunately, when they are unable
				to identify an object, they rely on an investigatory bite to gather more information.
				White sharks don't have arms like we humans do and so their mouths are their best 
				exploratory tool when it comes to up-close investigations.</p>
			<h4>Mistaken Identity Theory:</h4>
			<p>White sharks have excellent senses.  They can detect sound and pick up 
				smells from hundreds of metres away.  A large number of attacks occur when
				water conditions are poor, leading many scientists to believe that bad
				visibility, background noise from heavy surf, and other conditions can
				cause white sharks to mistake humans for their normal prey.</p>
			<h4>Social/Defensive Theory:</h4>
			<p>White sharks defend their 'personal space' by communicating through body
				posturing and biting, and the less dominant shark is normally forced to
				give way to the more dominant.  A surfer or swimmer at the surface, 
				totally unaware of a shark's presence below the water, would be unaware 
				of a shark defending its space until bitten.  A shark could even view a
				person as a competitor when fish or other prey is in the water.</p>
